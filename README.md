ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mgallo2019 (Miguel Gallo)

I have great motivation to continue perfecting skills and grow professionally.
I am proactive and ambitious, always looking for new challenges.
Currently with personal entrepreneurship based on IT solutions

As a Database Administrator I work with a range of technologies, with
particular and extensive experience in all aspects related to MS SQL Server, BI (SSRS, SSIS, SSAS).

As a Developer I currently work with MEAN STACK, using ANGULAR +9, NODE.JS, EXPRESS AND MONGO DB or relational databases. In addition to the basic stack HTML5, CSS, BOOTSTRAP AND JS.
Also providing services on AWS, Oracle Cloud, Digital Ocean, among others.

I have experience in .NET C#, Powershell, Java, C.
I think it is a great challenge to continue learning other technologies and/or stacks.
What I call a cycle of continuous improvement.
